# 🗺️ Università - Study System Roadmap

> **Evidence-based study optimization with AI assistance**

**Status**: ⏸️ PAUSED (waiting for Hub V1.0)  
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-01  
**Progress**: 60% (Phase 2 - Note System Setup)

---

## 📍 CURRENT STATUS

**Phase**: Phase 2 - Note System Setup  
**Progress**: 60%  
**Paused On**: 2025-09-29  
**Reason**: Focusing on Hub development first

### When Paused
Was working on: Obsidian templates, workflow testing  
Next planned: Test workflow on real lecture, refine based on use

### Resume Conditions
- ✅ Hub reaches Checkpoint 2.2 (PDF Processor plugin) - **HIGHEST PRIORITY**
- ✅ OR exam coming up (urgent study need)
- ✅ OR Hub Checkpoint 3.1 complete (can test workflows)

**Why PDF Processor is critical**: Most study materials are PDFs (slides, papers). Hub's PDF processor = instant summaries.

---

## ✅ COMPLETED CHECKPOINTS

### Checkpoint 1.1: Methodology Research (100%)
**Completed**: 2025-09-23  
**Time Spent**: 5h (research-heavy)  
**Deliverable**: Study methodologies framework ✅

**What Was Done**:
- [x] Researched 5 methodologies (Feynman, Active Recall, SQ3R, Cornell, Zettelkasten)
- [x] Analyzed pros/cons of each
- [x] Selected hybrid approach: Active Recall + Zettelkasten + Claude assistance
- [x] Decided on Obsidian as PKM tool

**Learnings**:
- Evidence-based > hype (many YouTubers sell ineffective methods)
- Perfect methodology doesn't exist, personalize
- Simplicity crucial (complex systems go unused)

**Key Decisions**:
- **Active Recall**: Core (scientifically proven)
- **Zettelkasten**: For concept connections
- **Claude**: Assistant for explanations, not replacement
- **No Cornell Notes**: Too structured, slow

---

### Checkpoint 1.2: Obsidian Setup (100%)
**Completed**: 2025-09-27  
**Time Spent**: 3h  
**Deliverable**: Obsidian vault + templates ✅

**What Was Done**:
- [x] Created vault with folder structure
- [x] Template "Lecture Notes" (completed)
- [x] Template "Chapter Summary" (completed)
- [x] Tag system defined (#materia, #topic, #status)
- [x] Workflow documented

**Vault Structure**:
```
University/
├── 00-Inbox/          # Quick capture
├── 01-Lectures/       # Processed notes
├── 02-Summaries/      # Weekly synthesis
├── 03-Flashcards/     # Anki cards
├── 04-Exams/          # Exam prep
├── Resources/         # PDFs, slides
└── Templates/         # Reusable templates
```

**Workflow Defined**:
1. Lecture → Quick notes in Inbox
2. Same day: Rework in 01-Lectures (template)
3. Weekly: Synthesis in 02-Summaries
4. Pre-exam: Extract flashcards to 03-Flashcards

## 💡 INTEGRATION WITH HUB (CRITICAL)

### Why Università Needs Hub

**Phase 3 (Claude Integration) - CRITICAL**:
- **Hub PDF Processor**: Lecture slides → automatic summary
  - Time saved: 2h per lecture → 15 minutes
- **Hub Notifications**: "Summary ready, review now"
- **Hub Scheduling**: Weekly review reminders

**Example Workflow with Hub**:
```
1. Professor uploads slides (PDF)
2. Download PDF to Hub
3. Hub: PDF → Claude → Markdown summary
4. Hub: Notification "Slides summarized"
5. Me: Review summary in Obsidian (10 min vs 1h)
6. Hub: Generate flashcards from summary
7. Hub: Export flashcards → Anki
8. Me: Review flashcards (spaced repetition)

Result: 2h manual work → 30 min with Hub
```

**Phase 5 (Exam Prep)**:
- **Hub Workflow**: "Prepare for Exam" button
  - Gathers all notes → Claude synthesis
  - Generates comprehensive study guide
  - Creates flashcard deck
  - Schedules review sessions
  - All automated via n8n

**Phase 6 (Analytics)**:
- Hub tracks: time per activity
- Hub suggests: "You study best 9-11 AM, schedule lectures then"
- Hub warns: "Retention low for topic X, review more"

**Bottom Line**: Università is the PERFECT validation project for Hub

---

## 🎯 WHEN TO RESUME

### Primary Trigger (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
**Hub Checkpoint 2.2 Complete**: PDF Processor plugin
- This is THE killer feature for study
- PDF slides → auto-summary = game changer
- Immediate time savings measurable

### Secondary Triggers
- **Exam scheduled**: Urgent need for system
- **Hub Checkpoint 3.1 complete**: Workflows ready to test
- **Motivation shift**: Want to use Hub on real project

### Perfect Timing
**Resume after Hub Checkpoint 2.2**, then:
1. Test PDF processor on 5 lecture slide PDFs
2. Measure time: manual vs Hub-assisted
3. If time savings >50% → full system validated
4. Continue Università checkpoints with Hub assist

## 🚨 RISKS & MITIGATIONS

### Academic Risks
- **Over-reliance on Claude**: Lose deep understanding
  - Mitigation: Claude explains, you test yourself (Active Recall)
- **System too complex**: Spend more time on system than studying
  - Mitigation: Timebox system work, track ROI

### Technical Risks
- **Obsidian sync issues**: Data loss
  - Mitigation: Git backup + iCloud
- **Anki mobile**: Sync problems
  - Mitigation: AnkiWeb backup daily

### Time Risks
- **System setup time**: Weeks of work before benefits
  - Mitigation: Validate early (Checkpoint 5.2)
- **Maintenance overhead**: System requires upkeep
  - Mitigation: Automate everything possible via Hub
