## üîÆ STRATEGIC PRIORITIES

### Next 3 Months (Q4 2025)
1. **Hub V1.0 Core** (Checkpoints 0.1 ‚Üí 2.2)
   - Basic web app with Claude API
   - GitHub integration
   - Plugin system foundation
   
2. **First Real Usage** (Checkpoint validation)
   - Test Hub with Universit√† project
   - Validate PDF processor plugin
   - Iterate based on real pain points

3. **Expand or Polish**
   - If Hub works well ‚Üí add automation
   - OR resume MTG/Cucina with Hub assistance

### 2026 Vision
- Hub: Full agentic system (automation, intelligence layer)
- MTG: Deck generator launched
- Universit√†: Study system in production use
- Cucina: Meal planning active

---

## üí° CROSS-PROJECT INSIGHTS

### What's Working
- ‚úÖ Checkpoint system prevents timeline pressure
- ‚úÖ Focus on Hub first = right strategic choice
- ‚úÖ Repository as memory between sessions = effective
- ‚úÖ SESSION_HANDOFF in PROJECT.md enables continuity

### What to Improve
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to test Hub earlier with real project (don't over-build)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Consider smaller checkpoints (max 2-3h to complete)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Set checkpoint for "pause and validate" moments

### Patterns Observed
- Work best in 1-3h sessions
- Evenings more productive than mornings
- Mobile access (iPhone) is critical for adoption
- Visual progress (checkboxes) motivates continuation

## üéØ DECISION LOG

### Major Decisions Made

#### **2025-09-29: Hub Architecture - Desktop ‚Üí Web**
**Decision**: Build Hub as PWA web app instead of Tauri desktop app  
**Rationale**: 
- iPhone access critical for adoption
- Simpler deployment (Vercel vs app store)
- Cross-platform by default
- Easier iteration

**Trade-offs Accepted**:
- No direct filesystem access
- Slight latency (API calls vs local)
- Requires internet (offline mode limited)

#### **2025-10-01: Checkpoint System vs Sprints**
**Decision**: Use checkpoint-based progression (no time estimates)  
**Rationale**:
- Flexible time availability (ritagli)
- No pressure from missed deadlines
- Clear deliverables per checkpoint
- Self-paced learning

**Trade-offs Accepted**:
- Harder to estimate completion date
- Need discipline to avoid stalling

#### **2025-10-01: Focus on Hub First**
**Decision**: Pause all other projects until Hub V1.0 functional  
**Rationale**:
- Hub will accelerate all other projects
- Dogfooding = best validation
- Clear path to completion

**Risk**: Hub becomes infinite project (mitigation: checkpoints + real usage testing)

---

## üö® ACTIVE BLOCKERS

### Current Blockers
*None - clear path on Checkpoint 0.1*

### Potential Future Blockers
- **Claude API costs**: May need budget planning if usage high
- **n8n setup complexity**: First time self-hosting workflow engine
- **Plugin architecture**: No prior experience, may need research
- **Mobile testing**: Need real iPhone for PWA testing

### Mitigation Plans
- API costs: Start with free tier, monitor usage, optimize prompts
- n8n: Docker setup well-documented, allocate 3-4h for learning
- Plugins: Study Langchain plugin examples, start simple
- iPhone: Already have device, just need testing discipline

## üìã PROJECT SWITCHING GUIDE

### When to Pause Hub and Resume Other Projects

**Trigger Conditions**:
1. ‚úÖ Hub reaches usable checkpoint (e.g., after 2.1 - Plugin System)
2. ‚úÖ Real need emerges from other project (e.g., exam deadline for Universit√†)
3. ‚úÖ Hub checkpoint blocked (waiting on external dependency)
4. ‚úÖ Motivation shift (want variety, switch context)

**Process**:
1. Complete current checkpoint (don't leave half-done)
2. Update both ROADMAP.md files (global + Hub specific)
3. Commit with clear message: "Hub paused at Checkpoint X"
4. Next session: Load repo, read ROADMAP, I'll understand context

### Resuming Paused Projects

**When resuming MTG/Cucina/Universit√†**:
1. Read that project's ROADMAP.md
2. Check SESSION_HANDOFF in PROJECT.md
3. I'll summarize: "You were at [phase], next steps are [X]"
4. Start fresh with clear context

## üí¨ COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL

### For Claude (You!)

When I load repository in new session:
1. Read this ROADMAP.md first (global overview)
2. Read relevant project's ROADMAP.md second (specific details)
3. Read PROJECT.md SESSION_HANDOFF third (fine-grained context)
4. Summarize: "Working on [project], Checkpoint [X], [status]"
5. Ask: "Want to continue or switch?"

### For Me (Human)

End of every session:
1. Update both ROADMAP.md files (global + project-specific)
2. Mark completed tasks with [x]
3. Add new SESSION LOG entry
4. Commit: "[Project]: [what accomplished]"
5. Push to GitHub
